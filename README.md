Hangman
-------------

This directory contains the game Hangman, programmed in Ruby 2.1.2. This is my first project using git and Github, while at [App Academy][appacademy].

### How to Play

  + First run the hangman.rb file
  + For each prompt, insert "c" for a computer player, or "p" for a human player
  + Enjoy!

### Notes

  + Two computers can play against one another. To enable this, enter "c" for both players
  + The same is true for two human players. Instead, enter "p" for both players

### Known Bugs

  + If you insert an index already occupied by a letter when choosing the word, then that position will be overwritten.
